# Grocery List App

A simple web application for managing a grocery list.

## Features

- Add items to the list by typing and pressing Enter.
- Remove items from the list by double-clicking on them.
- Mark items as completed by clicking on them (strikes through the text).

## Code Overview

This app uses vanilla JavaScript to manipulate the DOM and handle user input. The code is organized into a few main functions:

- `addItem()`: Creates a new list item and adds it to the page.
- Event listeners: Handle user input (Enter key press, clicks, and double-clicks) to add, remove, and mark items as completed.

## Example Use Case

1. Type an item into the input field (e.g. "Milk").
2. Press Enter to add the item to the list.
3. Click on the item to mark it as completed (strikes through the text).
4. Double-click on the item to remove it from the list.
